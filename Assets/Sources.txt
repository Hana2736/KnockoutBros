AI Generated at Eleven Labs


Code fully generated by the Gemini Code Assist IDE Plugin:

-Logic for wave spawning on the survival level
-Camera following the player and taking input

Code heavily refactored using various AI tools:

-Game state manager
-Player controls

I designed all networking structures and lifecycle, and designed all game mechanics and behaviors without "inspiration" from an LLM.
NetServer is my own code, and NetClient mixes in unity-websocket, AI generated portions, and my own code.
